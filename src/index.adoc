== Introduction

JavaFX Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is based on the http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21[W3C CSS version 2.1^] with some additions from current work on http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work[version 3^]. JavaFX CSS also has some extensions to CSS in support of specific JavaFX features. The goal for JavaFX CSS is to allow web developers already familiar with CSS for HTML to use CSS to customize and develop themes for JavaFX controls and scene graph objects in a natural way. The JavaFX CSS support and extensions have been designed to allow JavaFX CSS style sheets to be parsed cleanly by any compliant CSS parser, even though it might not support JavaFX extensions. This enables the mixing of CSS styles for JavaFX and for other purposes (such as for HTML pages) into a single style sheet. To this end, all JavaFX property names have been prefixed with a vendor extension of "-fx-". Even properties that might seem to be compatible with standard HTML CSS have been prefixed, because JavaFX has somewhat different semantics for their values.

JavaFX CSS does not support CSS layout properties such as float, position, overflow, and width. However, the CSS padding and margins properties are supported on some JavaFX scene graph objects. All other aspects of layout are handled programmatically in JavaFX code. In addition, CSS support for HTML-specific elements such as Tables are not supported since there is no equivalent construct in JavaFX.

JavaFX has a rich set of extensions to CSS in support of features such as color derivation, property lookup, and multiple background colors and borders for a single node. These features add significant new power for developers and designers and are described in detail in this document.

The structure of this document is as follows. First, there is a description of all value types for JavaFX CSS properties.Where appropriate, this includes a grammar for the syntax of values of that type. Then, for each scene graph node that supports CSS styles, a table is given that lists the properties that are supported, along with type and semantic information. The pseudo-classes for each class are also given. The description of CSS properties continues for the controls. For each control, the substructure of that control's skin is given, along with the style class names for the Region objects that implement that substructure.

=== CSS and the JavaFX Scene Graph

CSS styles are applied to nodes in the JavaFX scene graph in a way similar to the way CSS styles are applied to elements in the HTML DOM. Styles are first applied to the parent, then to its children. The code is written such that only those branches of the scene graph that might need CSS reapplied are visited. A node is styled after it is added to the scene graph. Styles are reapplied when there is a change to the node's pseudo-class state, style class, id, inline style, or parent. 
CSS styles are applied asynchronously. That is, CSS styles are loaded and values are converted and assigned some time after a scene graph object has been created and added to the scene graph, but before the scene graph is first laid out and painted. In addition, if the styles that apply to an object have changed (for example, because its pseudo-class has changed), values from the newly applied styles will not be applied immediately. Instead, they will be applied sometime after the object's state has changed but before the scene is next painted. It is possible that a style might apply to a variable in a JavaFX object that had been assigned a value by a JavaFX program. Since CSS styles are applied asynchronously, it's possible that values might be assigned by a program and used for some time before being overwritten by CSS at an arbitrary time later.

Each node in the scene graph has a styleClass variable, a List<String>. This is analogous to the class="..." attribute that can appear on HTML elements. Supplying a string for a node's styleClass variable causes style properties for that style class to applied to this node. Styles for style classes can be specified using the ".styleclass" selector syntax in a style sheet. Note that a node may have more than one style class.
Each node in the scene graph has an id variable, a string. This is analogous to the id="..." attribute that can appear HTML elements. Supplying a string for a node's id variable causes style properties for this node to be looked up using that id. Styles for specific ids can be specified using the "#nodeid" selector syntax in a style sheet.

Each node honors a set of properties that depends on the node's JavaFX class (as distinct from its styleClass). The properties honored by each node class are shown in detail in tables later in this document. The property value that is actually applied depends on the precedence of the origin of the rule, as described above, as well as the specificity of the rule's selector as described in http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21[CSS 2^] . Ultimately, a property value string is converted into a JavaFX value of the appropriate type and is then assigned to an instance variable of the JavaFX object. 
CSS styles can come from style sheets or inline styles. Style sheets are loaded from the URLs specified in the stylesheets variable of the Scene object. If the scene graph contains a Control, a default user agent style sheet is loaded. Inline styles are specified via the Node setStyle API. Inline styles are analogous to the style="..." attribute of an HTML element. Styles loaded from a Scene's style sheets take precedence over rules from the user agent style sheet. Inline styles take  precedence over styles originating elsewhere. The precedence order of style rules can be modified using "!important" in a style declaration. 

Beginning with JavaFX 2.1, the Parent class has a stylesheets property, allowing style sheets to be set on a container. This allows for one branch of of the scene graph to have a distinct set of styles. Any instance of Parent can have a style sheets. A child will take its styles from its own inline styles, the style sheets of all its ancestors, and any style sheets from the Scene. 
A style sheet URL may be an absolute URL or a relative URL. If a relative URL is given, it is resolved against the base URL of the ClassLoader of the concrete Application class. If, for example, there is a main class com.wicked.cool.ui.Main that extends Application, the relative URL "com/wicked/cool/resources/styles.css" would resolve correctly. The relative URL "../resources/styles.css" would not since the path ".." relative to the root is not a valid path. It is often easier to use the ClassLoader of some class to find the resource. For example, if the "styles.css" file resides in the same package as Main, the following code will give the correct URL: com.wicked.cool.ui.Main.class.getResource("styles.css").toExternalForm()

Note that, beginning with JavaFX 2.1, a URL consisting of only an absolute path (having no scheme or authority) is resolved relative to the base URL of ClassLoader of the class that extends Application. In other words, "/com/wicked/cool/resources/styles.css" is treated as "com/wicked/cool/resources/styles.css". This is consistent with FXML. 
The implementation allows designers to style an application by using style sheets to override property values set from code. This has implications for the cascade; particularly, when does a style from a style sheet override a value set from code? The JavaFX CSS implementation applies the following order of precedence; a style from a user agent style sheet has lower priority than a value set from code, which has lower priority than a Scene or Parent style sheet. Inline styles have highest precedence. Style sheets from a Parent instance are considered to be more specific than those styles from Scene style sheets.
Naming conventions have been established for deriving CSS style class names from JavaFX class names, and for deriving CSS property names from JavaFX variable names. Note that this is only a naming convention; there is no automatic name conversion. Most JavaFX names use "camel case," that is, mixed case names formed from compound words, where the initial letter of each sub-word is capitalized. Most CSS names in the HTML world are all lower case, with compound words separated by hyphens. The convention is therefore to take JavaFX class names and form their corresponding CSS style class name by separating the compound words with hyphens and convering the letters to all lower case. For example, the JavaFX ToggleButton class would have a style class of "toggle-button". The convention for mapping JavaFX variable names to CSS property names is similar, with the addition of the "-fx-" prefix. For example, the blendMode variable would have a corresponding CSS property name of "-fx-blend-mode".

=== Limitations

While the JavaFX CSS parser will parse valid CSS syntax, it is not a fully compliant CSS parser. One should not expect the parser to handle syntax not specified in this document.

* `@`-keyword statements are ignored.

* The `:first-child` and `:lang` pseudo-classes are not supported. The `:first-line`, `:first-letter`, `:after`, and `:before` pseudo-elements are not supported.

* The `:active` and `:focus` dynamic pseudo-classes are not supported. However, Nodes do support the `:pressed` and `:focused` pseudo-classes, which are similar.

* The `:link` and `:visited` pseudo-classes are not supported in general. However, Hyperlink objects can be styled, and they support the `:visited` pseudo-class.

* JavaFX CSS does not support comma-separated series of font family names in the `-fx-font-family` property. The optional line height parameter when specifying fonts is not supported. There is no equivalent for the `font-variant` property.

* JavaFX CSS uses the HSB color model instead of the HSL color model.

* It is possible to use the JavaFX class name as a type selector, however, such use is not recommended. For example, it is possible to specify styles for a ToggleButton using the syntax "ToggleButton { ... }". Such usage is not recommended because the name used to match the type selector is the actual concrete class name used in the JavaFX program. This class name can change in the case of subclassing. If the application were to subclass the ToggleButton class, these styles would no longer apply.

* At this time, the programming interfaces necessary for a class to declare support for CSS properties, to convert and load these values from CSS style sheets into object variables, and to declare and notify changes to an object's pseudo-classes, are considered internal interfaces and are not accessible directly to applications.

* If a property of a node is initialized by calling the set method of the property, the CSS implementation will see this as a user set value and the value will not be overwritten by a style from a user agent style sheet. 

Inheritance

CSS also provides for certain properties to be inherited by default, or to be inherited if the property value is `inherit`. If a value is inherited, it is inherited from the computed value of the element's parent in the document tree. In JavaFX, inheritance is similar, except that instead of elements in the document tree, inheritance occurs from parent nodes in the scene graph.

The following properties inherit by default. Any property can be made to inherit by giving it the value `inherit`.

[format="csv", options="header", float="left" cols="^3,3,^5,10"]
|===
Class,Property,"CSS Property",Initial Value
`javafx.scene.Node`,`cursor`,`-fx-cursor`,`javafx.scene.Cursor.DEFAULT`
`javafx.scene.text.Text`,`textAlignment`,`-fx-text-alignment`,`javafx.scene.text.TextAlignment.LEFT`
`javafx.scene.text.Font`,`font`,`-fx-font`,`Font.DEFAULT (12px system)`
|===
	

Within the hierarchy of JavaFX classes (for example, Rectangle is a subclass of Shape, which in turn is a subclass of Node), the CSS properties of an ancestor are also CSS properties of the descendant. This means that a subclass will respond to the same set of properties as its ancestor classes, and to additional properties it defines itself. So, a Shape supports all the properties of Node plus several more, and Rectangle supports all the properties of Shape plus a couple more. However, because using a JavaFX class name as a type selector is an exact match, providing style declarations for a Shape will not cause a Rectangle to use those values (unless the .css value for the Rectangle's property is "inherit").

=== Examples

Consider the following simple JavaFX application:

[source,java]
----
Scene scene = new Scene(new Group()); 
scene.getStylesheets().add(“test.css”); 
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(100,100); 
rect.setLayoutX(50); 
rect.setLayoutY(50); 
rect.getStyleClass().add("my-rect"); 
((Group)scene.getRoot()).getChildren().add(rect);
----

Without any styles, this will display a plain black rectangle. If test.css contains the following:

[source,css]
----
.my-rect { -fx-fill: red; }
----

the rectangle will be red instead of black:

image::cssexample1.png[CSS Example 1]

If test.css contains the following:

[source,css]
----
.my-rect {
    -fx-fill: yellow;
    -fx-stroke: green;
    -fx-stroke-width: 5;
    -fx-stroke-dash-array: 12 2 4 2;
    -fx-stroke-dash-offset: 6;
    -fx-stroke-line-cap: butt;
}
----

the result will be a yellow rectangle with a nicely dashed green border:

image::cssexample2.png[]

=== Understanding Parser Warnings

When the JavaFX CSS parser encounters a syntax error, a warning message is emitted which conveys as much information as is available to help resolve the error. For example

----
WARNING: com.sun.javafx.css.parser.CSSParser declaration Expected '<percent>' while parsing '-fx-background-color' at ?[1,49]
----

The cryptic `?[1,49]` pertains to the location of the error. The format of the location string is
`<url>[line, position]`

If the error is found while parsing a file, the file URL will be given. If the error is from an inline style (as in the example above), the URL is given as a question mark. The line and position give an offset into the file or string where the token begins. Please note that the line and position may not be accurate in releases prior to JavaFX 2.2.
Applications needing to detect errors from the parser can add a listener to the errors property of com.sun.javafx.css.StyleManager. This is not public API and is subject to change. 


== Types

=== inherit

Each property has a type, which determines what kind of value and the syntax for specifying those values. In addition, each property may have a specified value of 'inherit', which means that, for a given node, the property takes the same computed value as the property for the node's parent. The 'inherit' value can be used on properties that are not normally inherited.

If the `inherit` value is set on the root element, the property is assigned its initial value.

=== <boolean>

Boolean values can either have the string value of `true` or `false`, the values are case insensitive as all CSS is case insensitive.

=== <string>

Strings can either be written with double quotes or with single quotes. Double quotes cannot occur inside double quotes, unless escaped (e.g., as `'\"'` or as `'\22'`). Analogously for single quotes (e.g., `"\'"` or `"\27"`).

[source,css]
----
"this is a 'string'"
"this is a \"string\""
'this is a "string"'
'this is a \'string\''
----

A string cannot directly contain a newline. To include a newline in a string, use an escape representing the line feed character in ISO-10646 (U+000A), such as "\A" or "\00000a". This character represents the generic notion of "newline" in CSS. See the `content` property for an example.

=== <number> and <integer> 

Some value types may have integer values (denoted by `<integer>`) or real number values (denoted by `<number>`). Real numbers and integers are specified in decimal notation only. An `<integer>` consists of one or more digits "0" to "9". A `<number>` can either be an `<integer>`, or it can be zero or more digits followed by a dot (.), followed by one or more digits. Both integers and real numbers may be preceded by a "-" or "+" to indicate the sign. -0 is equivalent to 0 and is not a negative number.

----
[+|-]? [[0-9]+|[0-9]*"."[0-9]+]
----

Note that many properties that allow an integer or real number as a value actually restrict the value to some range, often to a non-negative value.

=== <size>

A size is a <<<number> and <integer>,`<number>`>> with units of <<<length>,`<length>`>> or <<<percentage>,`<percentage>`>> If units are not specified then specified the 'px' is assumed.

=== <length>

----
<number> [ px | mm | cm | in | pt | pc | em | ex ]?
----

No whitespace is allowed between the number and units if provided. Some units are relative and others absolute:

Relative::
* `px`: pixels, relative to the viewing device
* `m`: the `font-size` of the relevant font
* `ex`: the `x-height` of the relevant font

Absolute::

* `in`: inches — 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters.
* `cm`: centimeters
* `mm`: millimeters
* `pt`: points — the points used by CSS 2.1 are equal to 1/72nd of an inch.
* `pc`: picas — 1 pica is equal to 12 points.

=== <percentage>

These are a percentage of some length, typically to the width or height of a node.

----
<number>[ % ]
----

=== <angle>

An angle is a <number> with one of the following units.

----
<number>[ deg | rad | grad | turn ]
----

* `deg`: angle in degrees - all other angle units are converted to degrees.
* `rad`: angle in radians
* `grad`: angle in gradians
* `turn`: angle in turns

=== <point>

A point is an {x,y} coordinate.

----
[ [ <length> <length> ] | [ <percentage> | <percentage> ] ]
----

=== <color-stop>

Stops are per W3C color-stop syntax.

----
[ <color> [ <percentage> | <length>]? ]
----

In a series of `<color-stop>`, stop distance values must all be `<percentage>` or `<length>`. Furthermore, if `<length>` values are used, then the distance value for first and last stop in the series must be specified. This restriction may be removed in a future release.

`red, white 70%, blue` is valid since the distance for red and blue is assumed to be 0% and 100%, respectively.

`red 10, white, blue 90` is valid. Because distance for red and blue is 10 and 90, respectively, the distance for white can be calculated.

`red, white 70, blue` is not valid since distance units do not agree.

`red, white, blue` is valid. The stops are distributed evenly between 0% and 100%.

=== <uri>

----
url ( [\"\']? <address> [\"\']? )
----

`<address>` can be an absolute URI, for example:

[source,css]
----
url(http://example.com)
url('http://example.com')
url("http://example.com")
or it can be relative to the location of the CSS file.
----

=== <effect>

JavaFX CSS currently supports the `DropShadow` and `InnerShadow` effects from the JavaFX platform. See the class documentation in `javafx.scene.effect` for further details about the semantics of the various effect parameters.

==== Drop Shadow

A high-level effect that renders a shadow of the given content behind the content.

[source,css]
----
dropshadow( <blur-type> , <color> , <number> , <number> , <number> , <number> )
----

----
<blur-type> = [ gaussian | one-pass-box | three-pass-box | two-pass-box ]
----

* `<color>` The shadow Color.
* `<number>` The radius of the shadow blur kernel. In the range [0.0 ... 127.0], typical value 10.
* `<number>` The spread of the shadow. The spread is the portion of the radius where the contribution of the source material will be 100%. The remaining portion of the radius will have a contribution controlled by the blur kernel. A spread of 0.0 will result in a distribution of the shadow determined entirely by the blur algorithm. A spread of 1.0 will result in a solid growth outward of the source material opacity to the limit of the radius with a very sharp cutoff to transparency at the radius. Values should be in the range [0.0 ... 1.0].
* `<number>` The shadow offset in the x direction, in pixels. 
* `<number>` The shadow offset in the y direction, in pixels.

==== Inner Shadow

A high-level effect that renders a shadow inside the edges of the given content.

[source,css]
----
innershadow( <blur-type> , <color> , <number> , <number> , <number> , <number> )
----

* `<blur-type>` = [ gaussian | one-pass-box | three-pass-box | two-pass-box ]
* `<color>` The shadow Color.
* `<number>` The radius of the shadow blur kernel. In the range [0.0 ... 127.0], typical value 10.
* `<number>` The choke of the shadow. The choke is the portion of the radius where the contribution of the source material will be 100%. The remaining portion of the radius will have a contribution controlled by the blur kernel. A choke of 0.0 will result in a distribution of the shadow determined entirely by the blur algorithm. A choke of 1.0 will result in a solid growth inward of the shadow from the edges to the limit of the radius with a very sharp cutoff to transparency inside the radius. Values should be in the range [0.0 ... 1.0].
* `<number>` The shadow offset in the x direction, in pixels. 
* `<number>` The shadow offset in the y direction, in pixels.

=== <font>

JavaFX CSS supports the ability to specify fonts using separate family, size, style, and weight properties, as well as the ability to specify a font using a single shorthand property. There are four value types related to fonts plus a shorthand property that encompasses all four properties. The font-related types are as follows.

`<font-family>` The string name of the font family. An actual font family name available on the system can be used, or one of the following generic family names can be used:

* `serif` (e.g., Times)
* `sans-serif` (e.g., Helvetica)
* `cursive` (e.g., Zapf-Chancery)
* `fantasy` (e.g., Western)
* `monospace` (e.g., Courier)

`<font-size>` The size of the font, using the `<size>` syntax.

`<font-style>`The font's style, using the following syntax:
----
[ normal | italic | oblique ]
----

`<font-weight>` The font's weight, using the following syntax:
----
[ normal | bold | bolder | lighter | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 800 | 900 ]
----

`<font>` This font shorthand property can be used in place of the above properties. It uses the following syntax:
----
[[ <font-style> || <font-weight> ]? <font-size> <font-family> ]
----

==== Font Properties

Most classes that use text will support the following font properties. In some cases a similar set of properties will be supported but with a different prefix instead of `-fx-font`.

[format="csv", options="header", float="left" cols="^4,^3,3,10"]
|===
CSS Property,Values,Default,Comments
`-fx-font`,`<font>`,inherit,"shorthand property for `font-size`, `font-family`, `font-weight` and `font-style`"
`-fx-font-family`,`<font-family>`,inherit,""	 
`-fx-font-size`,`<font-size>`,inherit,""	 
`-fx-font-style`,`<font-style>`,inherit,""	 
`-fx-font-weight`,`<font-weight>`,	inherit,""
|===


=== <paint>

Paint values can either be a solid color specified in one of the color syntaxes or they can be a linear or radial gradient.

----
<color> | <linear-gradient> | <radial-gradient>
----

==== Linear Gradients `<linear-gradient>`
----
linear-gradient( [ [from <point> to <point>] | [ to <side-or-corner>], ]? [ [ repeat | reflect ], ]? <color-stop>[, <color-stop>]+) 
----

where `<side-or-corner> = [left | right] || [top | bottom]`

Linear gradient creates a gradient going though all the stop colors along the line between the `from <point>` and the `to <point>`. If the points are percentages, then they are relative to the size of the area being filled. Percentage and length sizes can not be mixed in a single gradient function.

If neither repeat nor reflect are given, then the `CycleMethod` defaults `NO_CYCLE`.
If neither `from <point> to <point>` nor `to <side-or-corner>` are given, then the gradient direction defaults to `to bottom`.
Stops are per W3C color-stop syntax and are normalized accordingly.

This example will create a gradient from top left to bottom right of the filled area with red at the top left corner and black at the bottom right.

[source,css]
----
linear-gradient(to bottom right, red, black)
----
This is equivalent to:

[source,css]
----
linear-gradient(from 0% 0% to 100% 100%, red 0%, black 100%)
----
This more complex example will create a 50px high bar at the top with a 3 color gradient with white underneath for the rest of the filled area.

[source,css]
----
linear-gradient(from 0px 0px to 0px 50px, gray, darkgray 50%, dimgray 99%, white)
----
[WARNING]
====
The following syntax for linear gradient does not conform to the CSS grammar and is deprecated in JavaFX 2.0. The JavaFX 2.0 CSS parser supports the syntax but this support may be removed in later releases.
[source,css]
----
linear (<size>, <size>) to (<size>, <size>) stops [ (<number>,<color>) ]+ [ repeat | reflect ]?
----
====

==== Radial Gradients `<radial-gradient>`

----
radial-gradient([ focus-angle <angle>, ]? [ focus-distance <percentage>, ]? [ center <point>, ]? radius [ <length> | <percentage> ] [ [ repeat | reflect ], ]? <color-stop>[, <color-stop>]+)
----

If neither repeat nor reflect are given, then the `CycleMethod` defaults `NO_CYCLE`.
Stops are per W3C color-stop syntax and are normalized accordingly.

Following are examples of the use of radial-gradient:

[source,css]
----
radial-gradient(radius 100%, red, darkgray, black)
radial-gradient(focus-angle 45deg, focus-distance 20%, center 25% 25%, radius 50%, reflect, gray, darkgray 75%, dimgray)
----

[WARNING]
====
The following syntax for radial gradient does not conform to the CSS grammar and is deprecated in JavaFX 2.0. The JavaFX 2.0 CSS parser supports the syntax but this support may be removed in later releases.

----
radial [focus-angle <number> | <number> ] ]? [ focus-distance <size> ]? [ center <size,size> ]? <size> stops [ ( <number>, <color> ) ]+ [ repeat | reflect ]?
----
====


=== <color>

----
<named-color> | <looked-up-color> | <rgb-color> | <hsb-color> | <color-function>
----

==== Named Colors `<named-color>`

CSS supports a bunch of named constant colors. Named colors can be specified with just their unquoted name for example:

[source,css]
----
.button {
    -fx-background-color: red;
}
----
The named colors that are available in CSS are: `TODO`

==== Looked-up Colors `<looked-up-color>`

With looked-up colors you can refer to any other color property that is set on the current node or any of its parents. This is a very powerful feature, as it allows a generic palette of colors to be specified on the scene then used thoughout the application. If you want to change one of those palette colors you can do so at any level in the scene tree and it will affect that node and all its decendents. Looked-up colors are not looked up until they are applied, so they are live and react to any style changes that might occur, such as replacing a palette color at runtime with the "style" property on a node.

In the following example, all background color of all buttons uses the looked up color "abc".

[source,css]
----
.root { abc: #f00 }
.button { -fx-background-color: abc }
----

===== RGB Colors `<rgb-color>`

The RGB color model is used in numerical color specifications. It has a number of different supported forms.

----
#<digit><digit><digit>
| #<digit><digit><digit><digit><digit><digit>
| rgb( <integer> , <integer> , <integer> )
| rgb( <integer> %, <integer>% , <integer>% )
| rgba( <integer> , <integer> , <integer> , <number> ) 
| rgba( <integer>% , <integer>% , <integer> %, <number> )
----
These examples all specify the same color for the text fill of a Label:

[source,css]
----
.label { -fx-text-fill: #f00 } /* #rgb */
.label { -fx-text-fill: #ff0000 } /* #rrggbb */
.label { -fx-text-fill: rgb(255,0,0) }
.label { -fx-text-fill: rgb(100%, 0%, 0%) }
.label { -fx-text-fill: rgba(255,0,0,1) }
----

===== RGB Hex
 The format of an RGB value in hexadecimal notation is a ‘#’ immediately followed by either three or six hexadecimal characters. The three-digit RGB notation (#rgb) is converted into six-digit form (#rrggbb) by replicating digits, not by adding zeros. For example, #fb0 expands to #ffbb00. This ensures that white (#ffffff) can be specified with the short notation (#fff) and removes any dependencies on the color depth of the display.

===== RGB Decimal or Percent
The format of an RGB value in the functional notation is ‘rgb(’ followed by a comma-separated list of three numerical values (either three decimal integer values or three percentage values) followed by ‘)’. The integer value 255 corresponds to 100%, and to F or FF in the hexadecimal notation: rgb(255,255,255) = rgb(100%,100%,100%) = #FFF. White space characters are allowed around the numerical values.

===== RGB + Alpha
This is an extension of the RGB color model to include an ‘alpha’ value that specifies the opacity of a color. This is accomplished via a functional syntax of the form rgba(...) form that takes a fourth parameter which is the alpha value. The alpha value must be a number in the range 0.0 (representing completely transparent) and 1.0 (completely opaque). As with the rgb() function, the red, green, and blue values may be decimal integers or percentages. The following examples all specify the same color:

[source,css]
----
.label { -fx-text-fill: rgb(255,0,0) } /* integer range 0 - 255*/
.label { -fx-text-fill: rgba(255,0,0,1) /* the same, with explicit opacity of 1 */
.label { -fx-text-fill: rgb(100%,0%,0%) } /* float range 0.0% - 100.0% */
.label { -fx-text-fill: rgba(100%,0%,0%,1) } /* the same, with explicit opacity of 1 */
----

===== HSB Colors `<hsb-color>`
Colors can be specified using the HSB (sometimes called HSV) color model, as follows:

----
hsb( <number> , <number>% , <number>% ) | hsba( <number> , <number>% , <number>% , <number> )
----

The first number is hue, a number in the range 0 to 360 degrees. The second number is saturation, a percentage in the range 0% to 100%. The third number is brightness, also a percentage in the range 0% to 100%. The `hsba(...)` form takes a fourth parameter at the end which is a alpha value in the range 0.0 to 1.0, specifying completely transparent and completely opaque, respectively.

===== Color Functions `<color-function>`

JavaFX supports some color computation functions. These compute new colors from input colors at the time the color style is applied. This enables a color theme to be specified using a single base color and to have variant colors computed from that base color. There are two color functions: `derive()` and `ladder()`.
----
<derive> | <ladder>
----
====== Derive `<derive>`

----
derive( <color> , <number>% )
----

The derive function takes a color and computes a brighter or darker version of that color. The second parameter is the brightness offset, ranging from -100% to 100%. Positive percentages indicate brighter colors and negative percentages indicate darker colors. A value of -100% means completely black, 0% means no change in brightness, and 100% means completely white.

====== Ladder<ladder>

----
ladder(<color> , <color-stop> [, <color-stop>]+)
----

The ladder function interpolates between colors. The effect is as if a gradient is created using the stops provided, and then the brightness of the provided <color> is used to index a color value within that gradient. At 0% brightness, the color at the 0.0 end of the gradient is used; at 100% brightness, the color at the 1.0 end of the gradient is used; and at 50% brightness, the color at 0.5, the midway point of the gradient, is used. Note that no gradient is actually rendered. This is merely an interpolation function that results in a single color.

Stops are per http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-images-3/#color-stop-syntax[W3C color-stop syntax^] and are normalized accordingly.

For example, you could use the following if you want the text color to be black or white depending upon the brightness of the background.

[source,css]
----
background: white;
-fx-text-fill: ladder(background, white 49%, black 50%);
----
The resulting `-fx-text-fill` value will be black, because the background (white) has a brightness of 100%, and the color at 1.0 on the gradient is black. If we were to change the background color to black or dark grey, the brightness would be less than 50%, giving an -fx-text-fill value of white.

[WARNING]
====
The following syntax for radial gradient does not conform to the CSS grammar and is deprecated in JavaFX 2.0. The JavaFX 2.0 CSS parser supports the syntax but this support may be removed in later releases.
----
ladder(<color>) stops [ ( <number> , <color> ) ]+
----

The Scene object has no settable CSS properties, nor does it have any pseudo-classes. However, the root node of the scene is assigned the style class "root" (in addition to style classes already assigned to the node). This is useful because the root node of Scene is the root container for all active scene graph nodes. Thus, it can serve as a container for properties that are inherited or looked up.

=== javafx.scene.layout.Region

_Style class: empty by default_

A `Region` is a `Node` (extending from `Parent`) with backgrounds and borders that are styleable via CSS. A `Region` is typically a rounded rectangle, though this can be modified through CSS to be an arbitrary shape. Regions can contain other Region objects (sub-regions) or they can contain sub-controls. All Regions have the same set of CSS properties as described below.

Each `Region` consists of several layers, painted from bottom to top, in this order:

. background fills
. background images
. contents
. border strokes
. border images

The background and border mechanisms are patterned after the CSS 3 draft backgrounds and borders module. See http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background[here^] for a detailed description.

Background fills are specified with the properties `-fx-background-color`, `-fx-background-radius` and `-fx-background-insets`. The `-fx-background-color` property is a series of one or more comma-separated `<paint>` values. The number of values in the series determines the number of background rectangles that are painted. Background rectangles are painted in the order specified using the given <paint> value. Each background rectangle can have different radii and insets. The -fx-background-radius and -fx-background-insets properties are series of comma-separated values (or sets of values). The radius and insets values used for a particular background are the found in the corresponding position in the -fx-background-radius and -fx-background-insets series. For example, suppose a series of three values is given for the -fx-background-color property. A series of three values should also be specified for the -fx-background-radius and -fx-background-insets properties. The first background will be painted using the first radius value and first insets value, the second background will be painted with the second radius value and second insets value, and so forth.

Note also that properties such as -fx-background-radius and -fx-background-insets can contain a series of values or sets of four values. A set of values is separated by whitespace, whereas the values or sets-of-values in a series are separated by commas. For -fx-background-radius, a single value indicates that the value should be used for the radius of all four corners of the background rectangle. A set of four values indicates that different radius values are to be used for the top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left corners, in that order. Similarly, the -fx-background-insets property can also contain a series of values or sets of values. A set of four values for -fx-background-insets indicates that different insets are to be used for the top, right, bottom, and left edges of the rectangle, in that order.

Background images are specified with the properties `-fx-background-image`, `-fx-background-repeat`, -`fx-background-position` and `-fx-background-size`. The number of images in the series of -fx-background-image values determines the number of background images that are painted. The -fx-background-repeat, -fx-background-position, and -fx-background-size properties each can contain a series of values. For each item in the -fx-background-image series, the corresponding items in the -fx-background-repeat, -fx-background-position, and -fx-background-size properties are applied to that background image.

Stroked borders are specified with the properties `-fx-border-color`, `-fx-border-style`, `-fx-border-width`, -`fx-border-radius` and `-fx-border-insets`. Each property contains a series of items. The number of items in the-fx- border-color property determines the number of borders that are painted. Each border in the series is painted using information from the corresponding series item of the -fx-border-style, -fx-border-width, -fx-border-radius, and -fx-border-insets properties.

Image borders are specified with the properties `-fx-border-image-source`, `-fx-border-image-repeat`, `-fx-border-image-slice`, `-fx-border-image-width` and `-fx-border-image-insets`. Each property contains a series of items. The number of items in the -fx-border-image-source property determines the number of images that are painted. Each image in the series is painted using information from the corresponding series items of the -fx-border-image-repeat, -fx-border-image-slice, -fx-border-image-width, and -fx-border-image-insets properties.

The region's contents are a sequence of nodes, like any other container. The contents are set programmatically and cannot be set via CSS.

"A series of width or sets of four width values, separated by commas. For each item in the series, a single width value means that all border widths are the same; and if a set of four width values is specified, they are used for the top, right, bottom, and left border widths, in that order. If the border is not rectangular, only the first width value is used. Each item in the series of widths applies to the corresponding item in the series of border images. Percentage values may be used here, in which case the values are considered proportional to the border image area."
